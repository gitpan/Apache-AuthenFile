This module, Apache::AuthenFile, is an Apache/mod_perl authentication handler
to authenticate users using a password file (cf. the Apache built in method
"AuthUserFile" method).

To build and install it, please run

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

To read more about this module try

    pod2text AuthenFile.pm 

We need this module in cases where the system/web manager imposes a site wide
Perl authentication method from the system httpd.conf -- users who wish to
override the imposed method have to use a Perl method.
